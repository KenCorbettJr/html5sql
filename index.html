    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        html5sql is a light JavaScript module that makes working with the HTML5
        Web Database a whole lot easier.  Its primary function is to provides a
        structure for the <strong>SEQUENTIAL</strong> processing of SQL
        statements within a single transaction.  This alone greatly simplifies
        the interaction with the database however it doesn't stop there.  Many
        other smaller features have been included to make things easier, more
        natural and more convenient for the programmer.
    </p>

    <h3>Core Features</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Provide the capability to sequentially process SQL in many
            different forms:
            <ul>
                <li>As a single SQL statement string.</li>
                <li>As an array of SQL statement strings.</li>
                <li>As an array of SQL statement objects (if you want to inject data into the SQL or get a callback after each SQL statement is processed)</li>
                <li>As a string containing multiple SQL statements, each of
                which ends in a semicolon.</li>
<li>From a completely <strong>separate file</strong> containing SQL statements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Provide a framework for controlling the version of a database.</p></li>
</ol><h3>Example</h3>

<p>If you have tried using an HTML5 web database you know how
complex it can be.  Especially when you are setting it up your
tables in the beginning.  Well you will be happy to know this
is no more.</p>

<p>To show you what I mean and illustrate the power of this
module, take a look at this example:</p>

<p>Say you want to set up a table and insert a bunch of rows
into this table. If you are using html5sql you would just
put all the statements necessary to create your table into
a separate file, which for this example we will name
<code>Setup-Tables.SQL</code>.  This file would probably look something
like this:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE example (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, data TEXT);
INSERT INTO example (data) VALUES ('First');
INSERT INTO example (data) VALUES ('Second');
INSERT INTO example (data) VALUES ('Third');

CREATE TABLE example2 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, data TEXT);
INSERT INTO example2 (data) VALUES ('First');
INSERT INTO example2 (data) VALUES ('Second');
INSERT INTO example2 (data) VALUES ('Third');
</code></pre>

<p>With <em>html5sql</em>, to sequentially call these SQL statements and
create your table(s) all you would need to do is open your
database and then add a snippet of code like this:</p>

<pre><code>$.get('Setup-Tables.SQL',function(sqlStatements){
    html5sql.process(
        //This is the text data from the SQL file you retrieved
        sqlStatements,
        function(){
            // After all statements are processed this function
            //   will be called.
        },
        function(error){
            // Handle any errors here
        }
    );
});
</code></pre>

<p>With the the jQuery get function your list of SQL statements
is retrieved from your separate file, split into individual
statements and processed sequentially in the order they appear.</p>

<p>While this is just a simple example it illustrates how much
easier this module can make using an html5sql database.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>While all this sounds great, you may be wondering if
performance suffers when SQL statements are processed
sequentially.  The answer, as far as I can tell, is not that
much.</p>

<p>For example, html5sql was able to create a table and sequentially
insert <strong>10,000 records</strong> into that table varying amounts of time
but averaging somewhere <strong>between 2 and 6 seconds</strong> using the
Google Chrome browser on my desktop.  This test leads me to
believe large data sets should be handled by <em>html5sql</em>
quite well.</p>

<h3>Rational</h3>

<p>At its very core, SQL is designed to be a sequentially
processed language.  Certain statements must be processed before
other statements.  For example, a table must be created before
data is inserted into it.  Conversely, JavaScript is a very
asynchronous, event driven language.  This asynchronous nature
is very present in the HTML5 client side database spec and
introduces a high degree of complexity for the programmer.
It is for this reason that this module was written.</p>

<p>This library was written with the understanding that the W3C
has ceased to maintain the spec for the Web SQL Database.  Even
though they have withdrawn from the spec, because webkit has
incorporated it the number if internet users with a compatible
browser is still significant, expecially on mobile devices.</p>

<p>While this module decreases the complexity of using an HTML5
SQL database, it does not attempt to simplify the SQL itself.
This is intentional.  SQL is a powerful language and attempts
to simplify it seem to only decrease it power and utility. In
my experience, a better option is to just learn SQL better
so it becomes more natural. An excellent resource for learning
SQL is the <a href="http://sqlite.org/lang.html" title="SQLite Syntax Guide">SQLite website</a>.</p>

</ol><h3>Goals for the future</h3>

<p>I would like to continue to expand this library and incorporate
more ideas to help programmers use HTML5 web databases.
Eventually I would love to see this library used by everyone
who wishes to utilize the HTML5 Web Database.</p></div></div>
